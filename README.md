# Traffic Mannagement System (TMS) using Object Detection in Python

Machine learning has significant potential in the realm of traffic management. By observing traffic patterns, classification systems may detect congested regions. In this thesis I am focusing on vehicle type detection which would further contribute into TMS.The primary goal of this masterâ€™s thesis is to apply Machine/Deep learning approaches to evaluate the performance of three popular object detectors (Faster R-CNN, SSD, and YOLOv5) under real-time traffic conditions, prioritizing low processing time and high accuracy.

Also we will custom train these model on custom dataset
